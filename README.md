**PROJECT BACKGROUND**

I chose a racing game because I thought it would be a fun way to test reaction skills while providing a quick end game. I love space and the universe so that easily became the theme of my game. I threw it back to a retro vibe by giving it an 8-bit aesthetic.

The main approach to creating this game was by utilizing JavaScript's canvas. This allowed me to delve into collision detection and frame rates. Outside of canvas, I built internal timers and game speed/acceleration that acts as the motor of the game. Future additions will include: adding a second identical screen that allows a second player (movement with 'A' & 'D'), adding music, adding high scores, and adding "power ups."
